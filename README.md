Client Email Finder (CEF)

Note:	You can use 2Day trial version of a CEF.
Instruction for using CEF:
  1)	Run the CEF Version 2.1.0.
  2)	Enter the link, and press the “Find Email” button.
  3)	CEF will start scraping the internal and external link from the given blog site.
    a)	Because this is a client finder tool, so (it will categorize the links) ignore the internal link.
    b)	It will follow the external link and then look for its email.
  4)	When complete site is scraped, then it’ll move on the next section (email finding) automatically.
Points to be noted:
  1)	Maybe sometime it happens right at first launch (After installation): When you Run the CEF without activating it, it’ll not run. But after (at 2nd launch) it will    automatically activate the trial version.
  2)	When CEF shows: “------------ Website is Finished ----------------”:
    a)	Make sure: Right above the upper line CEF doesn’t showing the message “Check your internet connection.”
    b)	If CEF displayed the message “Check your internet connection.”: Then it means your internet is either too slow / Not working at all.
